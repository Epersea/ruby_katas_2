This is an exercise I used to practise backtracking algorithms, applying the strategy of creating a stack with intermediate steps/states in the way to a solution. 

The problem's description is as follows:

Monks and Demons: There are three monks and three demons on one side of a river. We want to  move all of them to the other side using a small boat. The boat can carry only two persons at a  time. Given if on any shore the number of demons will be more than monks then they will eat the  monks. How can we move all these people to the other side of the river safely?
